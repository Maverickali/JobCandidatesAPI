## List of Ways for Improvement

### 1. Adding Authentication and Authorization
- Implement API key or OAuth2 for securing the endpoint.
- Ensure only authorized applications can access and modify candidate information.

### 2. Adding Logging and Monitoring Tools
- Integrate tools like Application Insights (AppInsights) to log API requests.
- Set up monitoring to track performance metrics and uptime.
- Implement detailed logging for easier debugging and auditing.

### 3. Adding API Versioning
- Implement versioning to manage changes and updates in the API.
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing clients while allowing for enhancements and new features.

### 4. Considering Caching and Load Balancing
- Use caching strategies to reduce the load on the database and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
- Design the application to support load balancing to handle high volumes of requests efficiently.
- Containerization with Docker
